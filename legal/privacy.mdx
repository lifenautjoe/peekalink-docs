1\. Introduction
----------------

Welcome to **Peekalink**, a service operated by **Ankida OU** (Estonia, registration number **14938566**). We are committed to respecting your privacy and complying with applicable data protection laws, including the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.

2\. What Data We Collect and Why
--------------------------------

*   **Link Preview Data**: When you request a link preview, we fetch and store relevant metadata and media files. We do this **solely** to provide our link preview service.
    
*   **Usage Information**: We gather limited usage logs (e.g., request timestamps, API usage counts) to **improve** our platform and maintain reliability. We do **not** use this data for advertising or profiling.
    
*   **Contact Information**: If you reach out to us via email or other channels, we may store your email address or message content to respond to your inquiries.
    

3\. How We Store and Process Data
---------------------------------

*   **Cloudflare**: We utilize **Cloudflare** to store and distribute certain media files (such as preview images).
    
*   **Hetzner Data Centers**: Our servers are hosted within **Hetzner** data centers.
    
*   **Security Measures**: We implement industry-standard security measures to protect stored data. We do not share or sell any personal information to unauthorized third parties.
    

4\. Legal Basis
---------------

We process your data based on:

*   **Legitimate Interests**: Providing and improving our link preview service.
    
*   **Consent**: If you explicitly give us permission in specific cases (e.g., support requests).
    

5\. Data Retention
------------------

We keep usage logs and preview data only as long as necessary to:

1.  Deliver the service,
    
2.  Improve platform performance, and
    
3.  Comply with legal obligations.
    

Once data is no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize it.

6\. Your Rights Under GDPR
--------------------------

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, you have the right to:

*   **Access**: Request a copy of the data we hold about you.
    
*   **Rectification**: Correct inaccurate personal data.
    
*   **Erasure**: Request deletion of personal data under certain circumstances.
    
*   **Restriction**: Request to limit how we process your data.
    
*   **Portability**: Obtain a copy of your data in a structured, machine-readable format.
    
*   **Objection**: Object to data processing in certain situations.
    

To exercise these rights, please contact us at [**support@peekalink.io**](mailto:support@peekalink.io).

7\. Third-Party Services
------------------------

We do not engage third parties for marketing or profiling. Any third-party sub-processors (such as **Cloudflare** or **Hetzner**) are used strictly for service delivery and are contractually bound to comply with GDPR and other relevant data protection laws.

8\. International Data Transfers
--------------------------------

Because our infrastructure is located in **Hetzner** data centers (EU-based) and we use **Cloudflare** (with global edge nodes), your data may be processed outside your country of residence. We ensure these transfers have **appropriate safeguards** (e.g., standard contractual clauses or equivalent measures) in place.

9\. Changes to This Policy
--------------------------

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect service improvements or legal changes. We encourage you to review this page periodically. Material changes will be communicated via email or a prominent notice on our website.
