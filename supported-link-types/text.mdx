**Type Value:** `TEXT`  
**Status:** PRODUCTION

A `TEXT` link type represents a plain text resourceâ€”such as a `.txt` file or other raw textual content accessible via a URL. Beyond the common preview attributes (`title`, `description`, `image`), `TEXT` links may provide estimated reading time and direct access to the raw text data.

## What It Includes

When `type` is `TEXT`, the response includes a `text` object with fields like:

- **size:** The size of the text content in bytes.
- **estimatedReadingTime:** Approximate reading time in minutes, based on the text length.
- **rawTextUrl:** A URL to retrieve the raw text content.
- **image:** A responsive image object providing various resolutions, if applicable.

These fields allow you to offer a direct reading experience or content analysis. For example, you might display the estimated reading time next to the title or provide a link to the raw text for users who want to read the full content inline.

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.peekalink.io/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"link": "https://example.com/notes/meeting.txt"}'
```
