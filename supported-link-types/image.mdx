**Type Value:** `IMAGE`  
**Status:** PRODUCTION

An `IMAGE` link type represents direct image files (e.g., JPEG, PNG, WebP, SVG, ICO) accessible at a given URL. In addition to the standard preview fields (`title`, `description`, `image`), `IMAGE` links include detailed information about the image’s dimensions, format, size, and even extracted color palettes—letting you provide a richer, more visual preview experience.

## What It Includes

When `type` is `IMAGE`, the response includes an `image` object with the following fields:

- **width, height:** Dimensions of the image in pixels.
- **size:** File size in bytes.
- **format:** The image’s file format (e.g. `jpeg`, `png`).
- **hasAlphaChannel:** Indicates if the image supports transparency.
- **Color Analysis:** Additional optional fields like `backgroundColor`, `vibrantColor`, `mutedColor`, and their variants to help identify dominant and standout colors.
- **Responsive Image Assets:** Multiple versions (`thumbnail`, `medium`, `large`, `original`) of the image at different resolutions, making it easy to serve the right size for various screen sizes or use cases.

These details help you optimize image display in your application. For example, you can choose a low-resolution thumbnail for quick loading and transition to a higher resolution image on demand, or use extracted colors to style your interface.

## Special Notes

- **Color Palette Insights:** Extracted colors let you create color-coordinated UI elements, such as backgrounds or borders that match the image's theme.
- **Responsive Assets:** Multiple resolutions of the image help optimize performance, especially on mobile devices or slow networks.
