## Special Notes

- **Fallback Strategies:** Peekalink infers missing metadata to maintain a cohesive preview, even if the product page lacks certain details.
- **Price & Feature Highlights:** Use pricing, rating, and feature sets to help users quickly assess product suitability.
- **Media Integration:** With multiple images and responsive assets, you can tailor the visual presentation to various screen sizes or design layouts.
