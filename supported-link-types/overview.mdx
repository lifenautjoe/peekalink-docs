Peekalink transforms virtually any URL into a rich, structured preview. Every supported link type—be it a simple webpage, a social media post, or an e-commerce product—provides a baseline set of attributes like `title`, `description`, and `image`.

From there, each type may offer additional fields that let you surface platform-specific insights.

You can identify the exact type of link from the `type` attribute in the response, which will be one of:
- Basic types: `IMAGE`, `VIDEO`, `AUDIO`, `DOCUMENT`, `TEXT`, `PAGE`
- Social media: `YOUTUBE_VIDEO`, `YOUTUBE_USER`, `X_POST`, `X_USER`, `INSTAGRAM_POST`, `INSTAGRAM_USER`, `TIKTOK_VIDEO`, `TIKTOK_USER`
- Community platforms: `REDDIT_POST`, `REDDIT_USER`, `REDDIT_SUBREDDIT`
- E-commerce & Development: `AMAZON_PRODUCT`, `ETSY_PRODUCT`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`
- Fallback: `UNKNOWN`

## Start Simple, Grow Incrementally

Integrating Peekalink can be done in around **5 minutes** by relying solely on the common attributes that all supported link types share.

These baseline fields let you easily display titles, descriptions, and images without worrying about the underlying source.

As your needs evolve, you can selectively integrate more complex data—like a YouTube video's `viewCount` or a Reddit post's `upvotes`—enhancing the user experience without having to overhaul your initial implementation.

This incremental approach means you can start fast and iterate as your application grows.

## Common Fields for All Supported Types

No matter the link type, when `ok: true`:
- **type:** The specific type of content (one of the values listed above)
- **icon:** A small image object representing the domain of the link, containing a `backgroundColor` attribute when the icon is  transparent.
- **title:** A headline or name for the content.
- **description:** A text snippet summarizing the link's content.
- **image:** A representative image chosen or generated by Peekalink.

These fields alone give you a visually appealing preview. With them, you can easily embed content previews in just a few lines of code, then layer in more data later on.

## Leveraging Platform-Specific Data

Once you've integrated the basic preview fields, expanding your integration to include platform-specific data is straightforward. For example:
- Add a video's `viewCount` and `duration` to enhance media previews.
- Display upvotes, follower counts, or product pricing to provide immediate context.
  
These additional fields let you differentiate your application, giving users a richer understanding of the content behind each link.
