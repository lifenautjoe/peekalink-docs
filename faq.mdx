Below you’ll find answers to the most common questions about Peekalink—why you might use it, how it works, what happens if you exceed usage limits, and more.

## Why should I use Peekalink instead of building my own Link Preview API?

Building your own link preview system requires significant development time, ongoing maintenance, and a dedicated infrastructure. You’d have to handle website scraping, asset processing, error cases, constant website changes, and scalability issues. 

Peekalink takes care of all those complexities with a single API call. We’ve spent years optimizing our system to handle thousands of different website structures. By using Peekalink, you save months of development time and avoid the continuous maintenance burden of an in-house solution.

## How long does a link preview take to generate?

- **First-time previews:** Typically **1–5 seconds**, which is similar to loading a webpage in your browser.  
- **Subsequent previews:** Almost **instant**, thanks to our background updates that automatically refresh and cache the content.

## How many links can I preview?

Your plan’s capacity is based on **hourly request limits**. Assuming continuous usage at 100% capacity, here’s how many monthly requests you can make:

- **Free:** 50 requests/hour (36,000/month included)  
- **Startup:** 500 requests/hour (360,000/month included, \$0.0003 per extra request)  
- **Growth:** 2,000 requests/hour (1,440,000/month included, \$0.0002 per extra request)  
- **Enterprise:** 10,000 requests/hour (7,200,000/month included, \$0.0002 per extra request)

---

## What happens if I exceed my plan’s request limit?

- If **extra requests** are **enabled**, you’ll pay a small fee for each additional request beyond your plan’s limit.  
- If **extra requests** are **disabled**, new requests will be temporarily blocked until the next hour begins.

We recommend monitoring your usage through our [Dashboard](https://www.peekalink.io/app/dashboard) to avoid any interruptions.

## I’m not sure which plan to choose. What should I do?
